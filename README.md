## What information is stored?

- Celestial stores your user ID if you've found a bug.
- Celestial also stores your user ID if you were in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/PrQFpP7Qzp)
- If at any time you were blacklisted, temporarily or permanently from our bot, **blacklist information will be stored**.
- When you get blacklisted **your user ID, the admin's user ID, the date, and reason are stored**.
- If you get muted, kicked, or banned from a guild, **your user ID is stored**.
- If your guild sets a **modlog, muted role, or prefix, the guild ID, channel ID, prefix, and/or role ID gets stored**.
- If you leave and rejoin a guild, **your user ID is stored in order to reapply the roles** *if the module is enabled by the server administrator*.
- If you create a playlist using the audio plugin, **your playlist and user ID are stored**.
- If you set a reminder, **your user ID is stored**. It does not store user data that was not provided through a command.
- If you set an AFK (away) command, **your user ID is stored**. It does not store user data that was not provided through a command.

## Why we store the information and how we use it.

- This information is stored in order to notify the bot **if you're allowed to run certain commands or not**.
- The muted data is stored in order **to keep you muted temporarily and to re-apply your mute if you leave and rejoin the server**.
- The banned data is stored in order **to keep you temporarily banned and to unban after the certain defined period of time is over**.
- The prefix and modlog information is used for the bot **to know where to send modlog messages and what prefix to respond to**.
- The mute role information is used in order **to apply a custom muted role when someone gets muted**.
- The profile data is stored in order **for us to put custom information on your profile**.
- The user ID is **stored for all of the above and for the express purpose of redisplaying**.

## Who can read this data?

- **People can only see if you're blacklisted when commands don't work**. The **detailed information can only be seen by Celestial Admins/Developers**.
- **All Muted, Mutedrole, Prefix, and Modlog data can be accessed by Celestial Admins/Developers**. Only **server administrators/moderators can see their own guild modlogs unless they wish to make it public**.
- **Suggestions and/or bug reports can be seen by anyone in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/PrQFpP7Qzp)**

## Questions and Concerns.
